        "<br><br>The alternatives to using a notebook are:\n",
        "- **Interactive programming**: through a **shell** (interpreter, console) one line at a time\n",
        "- **Batch programming**: running a whole **script** (a plain text file containing one to many lines of code)\n",
        "- With the help of a GUI (graphical user interface). GUIs for coding are called **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**.\n",
        "    - Some Python IDES: Spyder, PyCharm, Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, VS Code. Databricks and other compute environments also have their own IDEs built in.\n",
        "    - IDEs provide helpful features like tab-complete when you're typing a variable name, automatically adding a closing quotation mark when you start typing a string, and color coding of different code components. You can usually customize or turn off these features as you like.\n",
        "\n",
        "*The Jupyter Notebook we're working in now can be used for both interactive (one line at a time) and batch programming (many lines at a time).*\n",
        "\n",
        "#### <br>What is Jupyter?\n",
        "Jupyter is a non-profit, open source organization that created the original coding notebooks. Because they are **open source**, meaning they make their code available to all, almost all Python notebooks today are built with code that was written for Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### <br>More tips for using Jupyter notebooks\n",
        "- Everyone's notebook will look a little different, depending on if you are running it locally through Jupyter Lab or another IDE on your computer, or on a cloud compute environment like Google Colab, GitHub Codespaces, or Databricks. You will also see small differences between operating systems (Mac or a PC) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.).\n",
        "- Jupyter notebooks automatically save changes as you work.\n",
        "- **AI coding assistants** are now turned on by default in most notebooks. The specific LLM will vary, depending on your IDE. For this workshop, you are welcome to try it out during breaks, but I think you are here to learn how to code, so you probably don't want to cheat on today's exercises. But your learning is in your hands! You can turn off the AI features for this workshop, and we will go over that now."
